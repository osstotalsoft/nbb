.Net Building Blocks

Build cutting-edge, cloud-ready, scalable, maintanable and fun LOB services with .Net Building Blocks

Combining domain-drven design tactical patterns with clean architecture by decoupling the bussiness model and use-cases of the application with the rest of the technology and infrastructure, you get a technology-independent, hand-crafted, stable, encapsulated business model that will evolve over time, regardles the UI, Database, Messaging or other infrastructure or technology.

Applying concepts from EDA, CQRS or ES we decouple furthermore the business domain from the read-side so that the domain would not change when the UI views needs to change.

Applying concepts from the Microservices architectural style, you get a new beggining with every new bounded context (module).
