Messaging
===============

When it comes to messaging systems we embrace the Microservices philosophy:
> smart endpoints dumb pipes


Althought NBB targets distributed systems, the messaging system is not a core building block, it is treated as an infrastructure detail.
It is your choice to make to use or not to use one, and what provider to choose. (Note. You may choose to integrate services via Http or Event Store Streams).


Messaging abstractions
----------------

The package *NBB.Messaging.Abstractions* contains some very lightweight abstractions over messaging concepts:
* Message bus (Pubilsher and Subscriber)
* Messaging transport
* Topic resolution
* Message envelope
* Message serialization

For more details see [`NBB.Messaging.Abstractions`](.//NBB.Messaging.Abstractions)

Messaging host
----------------
The package *NBB.Messaging.Host* provides an infrastructure for event-driven stream processing microservices.

It provides the following core functionalities:
* Raising a background (hosted) service that processes incomming messages
* Configuring the messaging subscriptions (topics, options)
* Building the incomming message pipeline

For more details see [`NBB.Messaging.Host`](./NBB.Messaging.Host)

Messaging Transports
-----------------
The message bus uses an abstraction over the messaging transport. The following implementations are currently supported:
* **NATS Streaming** (*NBB.Messaging.Nats* package) - https://nats.io
* **In-process** (*NBB.Messaging.InProcessMessaging*) - can be used as test doubles in integration tests

Other packages
-------------
* *NBB.Messaging.BackwardCompatibility* - used for backward compatibility with messaging policies from previous NBB versions
* *NBB.Messaging.Effects* - Messaging side effects and handlers for the NBB effects infrastructure
* *NBB.Messaging.MultiTenancy* - Support for messaging in multi-tenant environments
* *NBB.Messaging.OpenTracing* - Support for OpenTracing in messaging publishers and subscribers
