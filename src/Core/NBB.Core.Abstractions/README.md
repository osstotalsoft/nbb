# NBB.Core.Abstractions

This package provides cross-cutting abstractions and type extensions that other packages rely upon. 
The interfaces of this package are not intended to be directly referenced by the end-consumer.

As this is somehow the shared-kernel of NBB we strive to limit the surface of this package.

## NuGet install
```
dotnet add package NBB.Core.Abstractions
```
